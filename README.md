## Clever calculator

Improved version of regular calculator 

*This calculator supports:*

- braces `(` `)` 
- defining and remembering variables
- multiple operations in one request

> Note: this calculator does not support float raw numbers or variables.
> Instead `0.333` or `a = 0.333` use `a = 1 / 3`

*Used things: `deque` from `collections`, regular expressions `re`,
reverse polish notation creating and evaluation algorithms*
